# COVID_Final

Start with the Presentation file as that has a URL to an ESRI Web Map Presentation. 

After getting frustreated with MapBox's API giving me 404 errors I went down the rabbit hole of youtube tutorails
and then some time styling a 3d map that I'm pretty pround of, but how to display it if the API isn't working...? To the share button, 
and ESRI webmap was the solution. I'm not the biggest fan of ArcOnline as it's a bit clunky in my opinion but it allowed me to upload the 
WMTS from Mapbox as well as the shapefiles created from geojsons. Esri's Clunkiness did become an issue when I tried embedding the map to
an html file. When that became unreliable I shifted to an ESRI presentation.
